asyncframework - easy async python applications and serivces development library
===

`asyncframework` is my own view of easy async python applications and serivces development.

The main idea of this project is to give easiness of creation of various async services without
the needs to go deep into creating and managing multiprocess services, network interconnections
and so on.

Installation
---
You can use `pip` package manager to install `packets`. The most recent
version of the library can be installed directly from Git repo:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/Q-Master/framework.py.git
```

Usage
---
Mostly usage examples could be seen in tests directory.
The `asyncframework` requires `packets`.
